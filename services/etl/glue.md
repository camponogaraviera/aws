"AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easier to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources for analytics, machine learning (ML), and application development." â€”AWS.

For instance, it can be used to impart structure (create a schema) to data stored in an S3 bucket. It then stores that schema into an AWS Glue database.
