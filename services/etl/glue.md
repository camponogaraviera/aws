# About

"AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easier to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources for analytics, machine learning (ML), and application development." —AWS.

For instance, it can be used to impart structure (create a schema) to data stored in an S3 bucket. It then stores that schema into an AWS Glue database.
