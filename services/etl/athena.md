Amazon Athena is an analytics service that provides a way to query large datasets stored in AWS S3 and other sources, including Microsoft Azure Synapse Databases, through [Amazon Athena Federated Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-to-a-data-source.html), for analysis and visualization with Amazon QuickSight.

While Athena is primarily used for querying, its ability to transform data (using SQL queries to clean, filter, aggregate, and format data) directly in S3 (without loading it into a database first) makes it a valuable tool for the Transform stage in ETL.
