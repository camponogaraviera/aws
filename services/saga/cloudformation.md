# About

[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) is an infrastructure as code (IaC) service that allows you to easily model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources. [You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)
