# About

[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/cognito) is a service used for `customer identity and access management (CIAM)`, it handles **user authentication** (sign up, sign in) and can provide role-based access to AWS services through IAM. Cognito console creates IAM roles by default to provide access to specific services such as Mobile Analytics and Amazon Cognito Sync.

Amazon Cognito uses JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
