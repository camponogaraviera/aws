# About

"Deliver high-quality audio, video, and screenshare in your e-learning applications." —AWS.

[Amazon Chime SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/) is suitable for high-throughput, real-time audio/video communication (e.g., video calls). It uses WebRTC under the hood and includes built-in NAT traversal support using the ICE framework, without the need to set up STUN or TURN servers.
