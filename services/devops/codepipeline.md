# About

[AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/faqs) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the build, test, and deploy phases of the release process. It helps streamline software updates by integrating with other AWS services such as `CodeBuild`, `CodeDeploy`, `Beanstalk`, `CloudFormation`, `Lambda`, and third-party tools (e.g., `GitHub`, `Jenkins`). Pipelines are defined as a series of stages, allowing for flexible automation and fast, reliable delivery of application updates.

"[AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that enables you to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. With AWS CodePipeline, you model the full release process for building your code, deploying to pre-production environments, testing your application and releasing it to production. AWS CodePipeline then builds, tests, and deploys your application according to the defined workflow every time there is a code change. You can integrate partner tools and your own custom tools into any stage of the release process to form an end-to-end continuous delivery solution.](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/faqs/#topic-0)" —AWS.
