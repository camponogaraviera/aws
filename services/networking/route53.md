Amazon Route 53 can be used to register a new `domain name`.

Unlike `registro.br`, which is a management organization for `.br` domains (the ccTLD for Brazil), generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are managed by different registries (e.g., Verisign for .com). However, registrations for these gTLDs are typically done through accredited domain registrars or providers (e.g., AWS Route 53, [Squarespace](https://domains.squarespace.com/)), who interface with the registry on behalf of the customer.
