## About

EC2 is the Enterprise level for systems that will likely scale with multiple web servers. Each EC2 instance is a virtual machine in the cloud that shares the RAM memory of a single physical machine that can run multiple sandboxed virtual machines. A virtual machine provides full control over the operating system.

EC2 allows one to manage everything on the instance, including OS updates, scaling, load balancing, monitoring, and security. A single EC2 instance can host and manage multiple containers. There is **no cold-start** (good for WebSockets).

Note 1: A container is a lightweight, isolated runtime environment for applications, built from an image, that shares the host OS kernel but packages everything the app needs to run consistently anywhere.

Note 2: A containerized application is an application that is packaged along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations into a container, which can then run consistently across different environments.

## Deployment

Deploy long-running applications on an EC2 instance if you prefer to manage the infrastructure yourself. Containerization is optional.
