# No Backend Required

If the app is static (e.g., HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and runs entirely on the client side. The app can be stored on **AWS S3** and served via **CloudFront**, or hosted (stored + served) via **AWS Amplify**. 

The frontend code can directly consume third-party APIs (e.g., Stripe, Google Maps) and remain static (no backend).

# Backend Required

If the app needs server-side logic or stateful processing. 

- Examples: 
  - Saving and fetching user data (credit card information, shopping orders, invoices) from a database you control.
  - Serving protected content (auth, role-based access).
  - Running business logic that cannot be safely executed on the client.
