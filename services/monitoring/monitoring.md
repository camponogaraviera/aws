# About

[Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) can monitor Disk I/O metrics, Network metrics, and CPU metrics. It can also monitor AWS SageMaker training jobs.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk uses Amazon CloudWatch under the hood to monitor the metrics of your application for autoscaling EC2 instances.
