# About

When using AppSync and DynamoDB to design your GraphQL API, the GraphQL [Schema and resolvers](https://github.com/camponogaraviera/full-stack-roadmap/blob/main/backend/api/grahql.md#graphql-syntax) need to align with the DynamoDB access patterns.

- Single-table design in DynamoDB with GraphQL:

  - Improved performance and lower latency.
  - More complex and less flexible.

- Multi-table design in DynamoDB with GraphQL:
  - Less performant.
  - Less complex and more flexible.
